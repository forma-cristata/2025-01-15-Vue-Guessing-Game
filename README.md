# Vue.js Guessing Game

This project is a simple guessing game built with Vue.js. The user sets an upper bound and a number of guesses, then tries to guess the randomly generated number within the specified range.

## How It Works

- Set Parameters: The user inputs an upper bound and the number of guesses.
- Generate Number: A random number is generated within the specified range.
- Make Guesses: The user tries to guess the number within the allowed number of guesses.
- Feedback: Feedback is provided for each guess (too high, too low, correct).
- End Game: The game ends when the user guesses correctly or runs out of guesses.
